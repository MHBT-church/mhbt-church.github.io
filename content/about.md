MHBT is progressive in their praise and worship of the Lord Jesus Christ, and is diligent in showing the love of God to all. Whosoever will let them come!

> “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.”

(John 3:16–18 NIV)

# Example structure for About page

### Your Vision/Statement of Faith
What's your church or non-profit's vision? This is a great place to tell about it. You can take a look at our church's vision page for ideas. They have a separate page for their vision, which you can do, or you can include it on the about page. It depends on whether it fits in with the rest of the content on that page and how long the vision statement is.
I have seen some church websites include their statement of faith on their about page. This is an option, although may be better presented in a dropdown menu under "About Us." Regardless, people will want to read this so it should be included somewhere on the site.

### History
Not all about pages need a history section, but if you have a 100 year old church, you should tell about the history. People love to read about a church's roots and how it all got started. But if your church has only existed for a few years, it may not have much of a history, so this may not be a good option in that case.
If you are a non-profit, how did the organization get started? What prompted its beginnings? This would be a great thing to write about.
We did a website for a local church that is over 200 years old. Here's their history page for an example

### What to Expect/Times and Location/Welcome or Invitation
You may also want to include information for a new visitor on your about page. Details about the service, how to dress, where to park, and what you offer for their children would be of interest to most visitors. Again, this can be a separate page or you can include it on the about page. If you choose to have it as its own page, consider including a link to it from the About Us page. It helps your web visitors to have clear paths to follow to gather the information they want to know. We always recommend you put your service times and location on the homepage, however, you can repeat it on the about page if you want. That way, if someone misses it on the homepage, they can easily find it under about us. You can even include a map on the page to help your new visitors find you. This can get forgotten when you are trying to decide what to put on your about page, but is an important piece. You want your website visitors to feel welcomed to come and visit your church. How will they know they are? Invite them! We invite people to come to our house, and  we should do the same thing with our church. Let them know you would be happy to meet them and have them visit.

You may want to consider including a video on this page of the pastor and other leaders/members inviting people to your church. It adds a personal touch when someone can hear and see the pastor talking to them. Video can be incorporated into this page telling about the history or vision of the church also. It breaks up the written text as well as adding interest and professionalism (as long as the video is well done!)

### Our Location

{{< loc.inline >}}{{ partial "map" . }}{{< /loc.inline >}}

### Other Content
We have seen some church about us pages include information on their leaders or ministries. While this can work at times, we recommend creating separate pages for your leaders and ministries. These are popular pages among those who visit church websites, and it's best to have them clearly labeled so people can quickly find exactly what they are looking for.
